* Get data from wave_file
data <- Unpack data

* get the frequencies
frequencies <- Call fftfreq with arguments: frame_rate, 1 / frame_rate

* Split the data to usable chunks
splitData <- split data by number_frames / frame_rate

* Figure out the amplitures for each frequency
amplitude <- []
for each signal in splitData
	Push 1 / n * (absolute value of fft with argument(s): signal)

* Get final values
final_frequencies <- Call fftshift with argument(s): frequencies
final_amplitudes <- Call fftshift with argument(s): amplitude

* Print the values
for each amplitude_array, frequency in final_amplitudes, final_frequencies
	for each amplitude in amplitude_array
		if amplitude > threshold and frequency > 0
			print frequency: amplitude
